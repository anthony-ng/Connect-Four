# JavaScript Group Projects

## Learning Competencies

* Build a fully functional, JavaScript-heavy web application from scratch
* Use agile development techniques

## Summary

Good news: you know JavaScript! Or at least you think you do. For this challenge, you're going to be writing a large, JavaScript-heavy codebase. You'll need to keep it organized and readable and tested. And you'll be doing it in teams, using the Agile development process.

## Releases

### Release 1: Deciding on your project and MVP

You have a choice of two possible projects to work on: building a JavaScript version of Connect Four, or building a survey website (with lots of AJAX). Here are some possible user stories
for both:

**Connect Four**
> * A user can see a board
> * A user can see a styled board
> * A user can place a piece into a column
> * Users place alternating black and red pieces on the board
> * Users can't place a piece in a filled column
> * A user can see an animation when they place a piece
> * Users are notified when they win the game
> * Users have the option to play against the computer
> * Users are notified when there is no possible way for either to win a game
> * Users and computers have a limited time to move
> * Users and computers have an aggregate time limit, like in chess
> * Users can play against each other in the same browser
> * Users can play against a "smart" computer, that has an algorithm for determining the optimal move.
> * Users can play against a super "smart" computer, that optimizes its moves by making projections for future moves
> * A user can play against another user on a different computer, using Firebase.js
> * Add your own user stories

**[Survey Gorilla] - survey-gorilla-challenge repo**
> * A user can create a survey
> * A user can create a question on a survey
> * A user can create a choice to a question
> * A user can view survey results
> * A user can view a visualization of survey results
> * A user can take a survey
> * A user can create a question on a survey dynamically (with AJAX)
> * A user can create a choice to a question dynamically (with AJAX)
> * A user can sign in
> * A user is prompted to sign-in using a pop-up modal
> * A user can edit ther questions
> * A user can edit their choices
> * A user can edit their surveys
> * A user is prevented from taking a survey more than once
> * Add your own user stories

Before you start coding, decide what your Minimum Viable Product is. What are the features that are absolutely necessary?

***Declare your MVP in your README.md. This should be your first commit.*** As you finish sprints, you should update your README.md

### Release 2: Build it!

It's time to build this thing. Start a repository on GitHub as a part of your cohort's organization and get to work.

Be intentional about your workflow. Are you going to work solo or in pairs? How
are you going to do to code review? How do you plan on communicating with each
other? How are you going to handle deployment? How are you going to split the
project up so that you aren't constantly overwriting each other's code?
